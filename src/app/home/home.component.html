    <p>The app’s purpose is to define or translate the English-language terminology we use in the computer programming
      courses in the School of SDDS, for use by all students, whether or not English is a student’s first language.</p>
    <p>We have so many students who are learning English and computer programming at the same time, and that is a
      challenging combination. The technical terminology is often unclear, complicated, and sometimes isn’t explained
      well. For example, when we say “asynchronous”, what does it clearly mean in English, as well as in a student’s
      first language?</p>

    <p>A web API will hold the data for the app. To enable scale and crowd-sourcing of data, the professors will also
      publish a web API that will be designed to aggregate (with some data entry done by you) the terms that each
      student enters, for the benefit of ALL students.</p>
    <p>The web API will be posted to Heroku and Atlas, and will provide the data for the Angular app. The Angular app
      will also be deployed to a public host (Heroku), so that you can deliver it to other devices (including, for
      example, your smartphone).</p>
