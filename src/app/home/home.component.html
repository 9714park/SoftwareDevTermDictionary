    <p>The app’s purpose is to define or translate the English-language terminology we use in the computer programming
      courses in the School of SDDS, for use by all students, whether or not English is a student’s first language.</p>
    <p>We have so many students who are learning English and computer programming at the same time, and that is a
      challenging combination. The technical terminology is often unclear, complicated, and sometimes isn’t explained
      well. For example, when we say “asynchronous”, what does it clearly mean in English, as well as in a student’s
      first language?</p>

    <p>A web API will hold the data for the app. To enable scale and crowd-sourcing of data, the published web API will aggregate the terms that each
      user enters</p>
    <p>The web API will be posted to Heroku and Atlas, and will provide the data for application.
